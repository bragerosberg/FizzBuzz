# FizzBuzz
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz “.

## Implementation 
My take on the well known kata, the design is based on simplicity but also clarity, making it a few lines longer than needed but contributing on the generality.
